# Summary
Peekaboo is a blind auction for NFTs that improves upon existing mechanisms, like the ENS auction. Sealed bids are encrypted using assymetric (RSA) encryption, where the secret key is revealed only after a verifiable-delay function (VDF) is solved. The secret key is used to reveal all bids simultaneously as soon as the auction is closed. Only one reveal is required on-chain, which is to declare the winning bid. Our auction has a lower amortized cost and more seamless user-experience than existing NFT auctions on Ethereum. This is made possible by the novel 2021 <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1293.pdf" target="_blank">TIDE Encryption Scheme</a>, which we adapted to Ethereum by decrypting in a smart contract. 

Our logo was generated by <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/" target="_blank">DALL-E 2 AI</a> using the seedphrase, "peekaboo cute pink logo with cute kawaii style animal"

# How it Works

### Creating an Auction
To auction your NFT:
1.	Privately construct security parameter 1k and time parameter t.
2.	Generate a Public Key and Puzzle
3.	Send NFT, Public Key, Puzzle to our smart contract via the `createAuction` function. The inputs are emitted as an event.
4.	The auction is now in session!

### Bidding on an Auction
To bid on an auction:
1.	Encrypt your bid using the auctions Public Key (that was emitted when the auction was created).
2.	Send your sealed bid to the smart contract along with obfuscated ETH, via the `commitBid` function.
3.	The sealed bid is emitted in an event.

### Closing an Auction
Anyone can solve the auction's Puzzle (which was emitted in an event when the auction was created). Solving the puzzle reveals the secret key, which can be used to decrypt all of the sealed bids simultaneously. To close the auction:
1. Call the smart contract function `closeAuction` with the solution to the auction's Puzzle.
2. The solution is verified on-chain and emitted in an event.

### Revealing the Winner
Anyone can reveal any bid once the auction has been closed using the emitted secret key.  


# Developers

### Solidity Dependencies
We use foundry and test using the Demo and the Goerli testnet

### Python Dependencies for Demo and Cryptography library
```
pip3 install sympy
pip3 install gaussianprimes
pip3 uninstall pycrypto # Ensure this is not installed
pip3 install pycryptodome
pip3 install w3
pip3 install web3
```

### Deploying the smart contracts
```
./deploy.sh <private key>
```

### Running the Demo
The demo runs the end-to-end workflow on the Goerli testnet:
1. Creates an auction
2. Commits 4 sealed bids
3. Solves the cryptographic puzzle to reveal the secret key
4. Reveals the winning bid
5. Finalizes the auction (settlement)

```
python3 python/main.py demo --contract 0x397B9515A053c70620a34a4B92bc049F0e31F0da
